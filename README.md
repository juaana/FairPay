# The Fair Pay Project 🌟
Fair Income Splitter

The Fair Pay Project is a JavaScript-based initiative aimed at promoting fairness in expense splitting and income comparison among individuals. This repository contains the codebase for the project, developed as part of my JavaScript course. With a focus on equitable payment distribution and salary comparison, this project demonstrates my proficiency in JavaScript programming.

## Project Features 🚀
- Calculate equitable payments based on income disparities.
- Compare and analyze salaries to identify disparities.
- Interactive user interface for ease of use.
- Extensible and well-structured JavaScript code.
- HTML and CSS for a visually appealing presentation.

Explore the code, experiment with equitable payment calculations, and discover insights into income distribution. Your feedback and contributions are welcome as we strive for a fair and equitable world. 🌍💪
